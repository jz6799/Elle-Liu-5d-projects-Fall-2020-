                    Banksy, a British artist born in 1974, is the pseudonym of a "guerrilla" street artist known for his controversial, and often politically themed, stenciled pieces. Banksy began his/her career as a graffiti artist in the early 1990s, in Bristol's graffiti gang DryBreadZ Crew. 
                    <br>
                    In the late '90s, he/she began using stencils predominantly. Banksy’s work became more widely recognized around Bristol and in London, as his/her signature style developed. Currently, Banksy's artwork is characterized by striking images, often combined with slogans. His/her work often engages political themes, satirically critiquing war, capitalism, hypocrisy and greed. Common subjects include rats, apes, policemen, members of the royal family, and children. In addition to his/her two-dimensional work, Banksy is known for installation artwork. One of the most celebrated of these pieces, which featured a live elephant painted with a Victorian wallpaper pattern, sparked controversy among animal rights activists.
                    <br>
                    One huge mystery about Banksy is his/her identity. Banksy's identity remains unknown, despite intense speculation. Some people think Banksy is a collective of individuals, some think Banksy is Robin Gunningham, while others think Banksy is Robert Del Naja. What do you think he/she is? Or do you think Banksy’s identity should keep anonymous? 
                    <br>
                    Banksy's worldwide fame has transformed his artwork from acts of vandalism to sought-after high art pieces. Journalist Max Foster has referred to the rising prices of graffiti as street art as "the Banksy effect." Interest in Banksy escalated with the release of the 2010 documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop. The film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, was nominated for an Academy Award.
                    <br>
                    Now, is the picture shown at the top of the page a real artwork of Banksy? No. It is a work of a French urban stencil artist Jean-François Perroy, better known under the pseudonym Jef Aérosol. Spot more his works around Northeastern campus!
