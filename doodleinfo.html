			The neon sign is an evolution of the earlier Geissler tube, which is a sealed glass tube containing a "rarefied" gas (the gas pressure in the tube is well below atmospheric pressure). When a voltage is applied to electrodes inserted through the glass, an electrical glow discharge result. <br>
			<br>
			The word neon comes from the Greek "neos," meaning "the new gas." Neon gas was discovered by William Ramsey and M. W. Travers in 1898 in London. Neon is a rare gaseous element present in the atmosphere to the extent of 1 part in 65,000 of air. It is obtained by liquefaction of air and separated from the other gases by fractional distillation.<br>
			<br>
			The French engineer, chemist, and inventor Georges Claude (Sept. 24, 1870 - May 23, 1960), was the first person to apply an electrical discharge to a sealed tube of neon gas (circa 1902) to create a lamp. Georges Claude displayed the first neon lamp to the public on December 11, 1910, in Paris and patented the neon lighting tube on Jan. 19th, 1915 - U.S. Patent 1,125,476.<br>
			<br>
			Neon lighting quickly became a popular fixture in outdoor advertising. Visible even in daylight, people would stop and stare at the first neon signs dubbed "liquid fire."<br>
			<br>
			While having a practical function as a literal sign, neon extends as a metaphorical sign. As a symbol, it represents a series of seemingly contradictory things. In film and art, neon has come to represent both communal activity and loneliness; popular culture and subculture; opulence and decadence. These shifts in meaning are emblematic of the shift in the social position of neon that has occurred over time. “There’s a tight connection between inner-city decay and neon’s decline… an advertising technology once used to decorate luxury stores and churches turned into a symbol of the rundown and the red-light district,” Christoph Ribbat suggests.<br>
			<br>
			Neon is often associated with bustling cities such as Paris, Las Vegas and Hong Kong, it has certainly left its mark in Queensland. Pioneered in France by Georges Claude in the 1900s, neon signage made its way to Australia by way of his Claude Neon sign company in the 1930s. Neon signage in Queensland experienced peak saturation in the 1950s and 60s, particularly in Surfers Paradise, where neon signs illuminated a long stretch of the Gold Coast Highway.<br>
			<br>
			Neon was used as a beacon for advertising hotels, restaurants, nightclubs, theatres and local businesses. Neon signs were once widespread in regional Queensland with motels and service stations hugging highways featuring distinctive neon signs designed to attract the eyes and interest of passing motorists.<br>
			<br>
			The late 1980s and 1990s saw the steady decline of neon sign making, due to the advent of new technologies and a diverse range of social factors. With progress came new human desires—desire for bigger, faster and more flexible. Plastic and LEDs met these demands quite easily. Neon sign making as a craft is the anti-thesis of this. It requires an individual to have a highly diverse knowledge of light, science and glass bending. As a process it requires an investment of time and effort as signs are highly elaborate to design and then produce. In a society of high business turnaround, the time investment required to develop neon signs no longer matches the speed of the industry it was originally intended to serve.<br>
			<br>
			Today neon is experiencing a renaissance due to its ability to adapt to the needs of a new generation. While it is still applied in the development of signs for niche small businesses, it is now most commonly applied in art, where the presence of the hand and the human touch still holds its significant value. Neon lights have become a popular item when it comes to interior design. People love customizing neon signs and hang them on the wall or set on the nightstand. It also appears in artworks like music videos, films, or dramas to add a retro feeling.
